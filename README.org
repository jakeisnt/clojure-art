#+TITLE: Nix Flake Project Template

This is a basic template for starting projects. It provides a basic framework for building a package and exposing its development environment, meant to be used with direnv and nix flakes. If you aren't comfortable with direnv, please use the nix develop command.

Please feel free to open issues and/or send me suggestions for improvement - when it comes to flakes, I'm still a relative beginner!
